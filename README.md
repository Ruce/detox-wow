# Detox

Detox is an addon for World of Warcraft that automatically hides toxic chat messages.

### Features
- Whitelist players so their messages are never filtered
- Enable/disable filtering on certain channels, e.g. Guild chat

Never have your day ruined again by an unprompted whisper saying "you suck!" after a dungeon, raid, battleground, or arena match.
