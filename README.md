# Detox

Detox is an addon for World of Warcraft that automatically hides toxic chat messages. Available on CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/detox

### Features
- Whitelist players so their messages are never filtered
- Friends and guild members are automatically whitelisted
- Enable/disable filtering on certain channels, e.g. Guild chat
- Hotkey to show hidden messages (default is Ctrl-G)
- Throttle mode blocks toxic message spam

Never have your day ruined again by an unprompted whisper saying "you suck!" after a dungeon, raid, battleground, or arena match.
